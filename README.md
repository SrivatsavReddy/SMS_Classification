# SMS_Classification

 In this project, I used machine learning algorithms to distinguish between spam and ham
messages. I used SMS spam collection dataset from kaggle. This dataset contains a set of approximately 5572 messages that
have been labeled as spam or ham. The machine learning models built after the data is pre-processed . Then, the text is
converted into a bag of words.

Techniques used:

-->NLTK

-->Regular expression

-->TF-IDF

Models tested:

-->MultinomialNB()

-->RandomForestClassifier()

-->KNeighborsClassifier()

-->LogisticRegression()
